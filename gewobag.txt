An inventory provides an overview and improves controllability
Mission #1 deals with improving the management and maintenance of the systems by taking inventory of all heat-generating systems and their components. So far, only metadata such as type, year of construction and boiler performance is available. A detailed inventory should collect additional information, such as condition, wear and servicing requirements to optimise system maintenance and avoid breakdowns.

For this purpose, we are looking for innovative solutions and technologies that will make a comprehensive inventory of the systems possible and in doing so, make an important contribution to increasing efficiency and conserving resources.
