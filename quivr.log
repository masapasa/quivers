How do you use chatGPT to chat with your docs? 

Here is how you can chat with PDFs, Powerpoints, Excels, etc ... 
1 - Ingest the Documents with 
@LangChainAI
 

You can use one of the many Langchains document loaders to load any type of document. 

From CSV to PDFs, it has you covered.
In @Quivr_ap we use the PyMuPDFLoader that extract the content from the PDF
2 - Separate your documents into Chunks with 
@LangChainAI
 

Separating your document into chunks allows you to have bits of context from your document.
It is also a good time to add metadata.

In 
@Quivr_app
 we use tiktoken and Recursive text splitter.
3 - Create a vector from your chunks using 
@OpenAI
 

Once your documents are separated into chunks. You then use an embedding engine such as ADA.

It outputs a vector with more than 1500 dimensions representing your chunk.
4 - Store your embeddings into a vectorstore like 
@supabase
 

Once you have your vector representing your chunk. We store it in a vector store like 
@supabase
 which uses Postgresql and the plugin PGVector
5 - Now is time to get the users question 

You can create your user UI or use one like 
@Quivr_app
6 - Create a vector with the users questions using 
@OpenAI
 

Same process than with the Document. You create a vector with the users question.

Thanks to 
@LangChainAI
  simple to do with the ConversationalRetrievalChain
7 - Find the closest vectors from your question

We do that with 
@supabase
 function and 
@LangChainAI
 vectorstore similarity_search

It returns the closest chunks to your question
