"2.3 Innovation 
- Description of the technological or product innovation or the knowledge-based innovative:
Doze provides a comprehensive digital solution that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to improve wound assessment, treatment, monitoring, communication, and education for people with diabetic ulcers. We have several advantages over existing solutions in terms of functionality,  usability,  accuracy, reliability, and scalability. We use advanced algorithms to analyze wound images and provide personalized recommendations based on best practices and guidelines. We also integrate with electronic health records (EHRs) and other data sources to provide a holistic view of each patient's condition and history.

Our platform leverages AI to analyze wound images taken by patients using their smartphones. The platform provides immediate feedback on the wound type, size, depth, color, tissue type, exudate level, infection risk, etc. This allows patients to save time commuting to the hospital and waiting for health care practitioners. In case of emergency situations, the app guides the patient on what to do or where to go. The platform can use advanced algorithms to measure wound dimensions with high accuracy and consistency. To this end, we have already trained an Efficientnet model which recognizes DFU from normal skin 95% of the time.

It can also track the wound healing progress over time by comparing previous measurements. The platform can store all the wound images and measurements in a secure cloud database that can be accessed by authorized clinicians. The patient can communicate with their clinician via video call or chat through the platform. The clinician can review the wound images and measurements remotely and provide feedback on caring for the wound at home. The clinician can also prescribe medications or dressings through the platform. The patient can receive reminders and alerts from the platform to follow their wound care plan. The clinician can monitor the patientâ€™s adherence and outcomes through the platform. The clinician can also intervene if any complications arise or if any changes are needed in the treatment plan. The clinician can share the wound images and measurements with other clinicians within or outside their organization for consultation or referral. If needed, the clinician can invite the patient for an initial consultation at their clinic or hospital to examine their wound in person. The clinician can use the information from the platform to prepare for this visit.

- Development approach and current status of implementation (laboratory or functional models, if applicable):
We already have developed a computer vision algorithm to identify diabetic ulcers from normal skin. We have fine tuned mobile-size baseline network, EfficientNet-B0 which recognizes normal skin from ulcer 95 % of the time. The training was performed on the publicly available preprocessed data.
When the patients have more questions about their ulcer, patients can ask our question answer platform powered by chatgpt-like model. For this demo, we have used chatgpt, however in the future we will use open source model like BioGPT (microsoft/biogpt Â· Hugging Face), which we have trained on our own data. Please check our demo
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-SfYgJo8n4). We will work with the medical professionals and regulatory bodies to benchmark and define the accuracy level before testing it on patients."

Introduction to datalake
nubri has a concept of "datalake". They are ring fenced bodies of information that can be used to provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer questions on a particular topic.

LLMs are trained on a large variety of data but to answer a question on a specific topic or to be used to make deductions around a specific topic, they need to be supplied with the context of that topic.

nubri uses datalake as an intuitive way to provide that context.

When a datalake is selected in nubri, the LLM will be provided with only the context of that datalake. This allows users to build datalake for specific topics and then use them to answer questions about that topic.

In the future there will be the functionality to share datalake with other users of nubri.

How to use datalake
To use a datalake, simply select the menu from using the datalake icon in the header at the top right of the nubri interface.

You can create a new datalake by clicking the "Create datalake" button. You will be prompted to enter a name for the datalake. If you wish you can also just use the default datalake for your account.

To switch to a different datalake, simply click on the datalake name in the menu and select the datalake you wish to use.

If you have not chosen a datalake, you can assume that any documentation you upload will be added to the default datalake.

Note: If you are having problems with the chat functionality, try selecting a datalake from the menu. The default datalake is not always selected automatically and you will need a datalake selected to use the chat functionality". "nubri has created a datalake where you can dump any kind of data and get the best business intelligence and analysis. when you are ready to dive deeper into the datalake, you can simply connect data point from different files and ask questions which might not be visible from the surface. you cannot understand a trend of anomaly in the datalake? simply share your datalake with the concerned person who has more domain knowledge on the data types and brainstorm together. you can create, share, delete datalake and collaborate right from our application improving business intelligence and increasing sales for your product". come up with a unique name for such a product where you can create, share, delete datalake and collaborate with your colleagues. give me only complete correct complete business analysis of such a product
